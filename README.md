How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
We test at different points in the lifecycle of the code, program or software. One can write automated tests to incorporate in the Ci/Cd pipeline. One can also write specific manual tests. You can also do a manual code review. Having a peer review your code, program or software is also an excellent way to ensure that the code, program, or software is functional and secure. We must also remember that we base our tests off of the requirements which were established at the beginning of the software development lifecycle.   

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
We interpret user need and turn them into formal requirements. We can accomplish this by writing user stories and developing a storyboard of how the program will operate. We will also define what exactly the program needs to be able to do and have the user confirm that the functionality is recoreded correctly. Once we have requirements we can start developing the program. During this phase we do manual code reviews and maybe we write some tests. 

How do I approach designing software?  
I like to gather all my baseline requirements at the start. I find that getting the requirements as close to what the customer/user wants early on can save quite a bit of time on the development side. I then move into the whiteboard stage, where I may start designing pseudocode and maybe a UML type design. Once we have a general skelton I start actually writing the code and the specific tests for each method/function.
